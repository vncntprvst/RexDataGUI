% by James Cavanaugh 2001
% 
% Alteration, Robin C. Ashmore, 2008
% For some reason the Rex data files put down their -112 codes in a 
% funny place.  JC's code assumes that each trial start (1001) is 
% followed somewhere by a -112 code that gives info on where to find the analog
% data that matches the trial (starting at the 1001).  However, in the
% files I tested, the -112 code (and the time for that code stored in
% etimes) for the current trial is stored after the NEXT 1001 appears
% (after the 1001 indicating the start of the next trial).  What gives?
% But with the changes added here, the output matches what is seen
% in DEX.
%
% Robin C. Ashmore, February 2010
% Yeah, but only in some cases.  As a cludge for now, there are two
% processing modes that seem to cover all Rex data file cases.  Which is
% used depends on the value returned by rex_processing_mode.m.  See that
% file and comments below for more details.  If one mode doesn't work, try
% the other one by changing what rex_processing_mode.m returns.
